title: "Global Trade Statistics Analysis in Power BI"
---

* I used Microsoft Power BI and Data Analytics Languages: M and DAX to create report of Global Trade Statistics Analysis.
* I scraped through 203 pages of Commodity Trade Statistics Database, that contained data about 209 countries/areas from 1988 to 2019, cleaned the data by removing non-meaningful redundant columns. 
* I created a simple data model, created measures and built a report to tell story about global trade volume, trends, tendencies, and TOP players.
* I created navigation for an end-user to be easier to go through report.
