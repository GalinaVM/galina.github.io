I analyze data to deliver insights: describe the current situation, detect anomalous events, diagnose the causes of events and behaviors, predict future events, solve problems, and help make the right data-based decision.
I am Microsoft Certified: Data Analyst.
I have a Master's degree in Economics and I transitioned into data analysis from an analytically-minded role in procurement/logistics trying to solve problems of what inventory in what quantity should a company have, what's the optimal replinishment interval, how to save logistics costs and so on. That's how I built my first reports, dashboards, created forecasts, presented my insights and realized the strong passion for data analyses and data science.

## My toolbox:
MS Excel Expert (Hlookup, Vlookup, pivots and other advanced functions), 
Power BI (Microsoft certified), Data Analysis Expressions (DAX), VBA, SQL (Joins, Stored Procs, Functions in dialects: PostgreSQL, Oracle SQL, MySQL, SQL Server), Ad-hoc analysis, 
Tableau, Gretl, SSIS, SSDT, SAP, Python
